            your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay TraderClass the amount that is specified in the payment plan (as well as any applicable taxes) in accordance with the terms of such plan and this Terms
            of Service. You hereby authorize TraderClass to bill your payment instrument in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan (as well as any applicable taxes) until you terminate your account, and you further agree to pay any

            the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Services other than U.S. taxes based on TraderClass net income.

        <p><span class="titl">3.3 Recurring Subscriptions:</span> If you select a Service with an auto renewal feature (“Recurring Subscription”), you authorize TraderClass to maintain your account information and charge that account automatically upon
            the renewal of the Service you choose with no further action required by you. In the event that TraderClass is unable to charge your account as authorized by you when you enrolled in a Recurring Subscription, TraderClass, may, in its sole
            discretion: (i) bill you for your Service and suspend your access to the Service until payment is received, and/or (ii) seek to update your account information through third party sources (i.e., your bank or a payment processor) to continue
            charging your account as authorized by you.</p>
        <p>TraderClass may change the price for Recurring Subscriptions from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Recurring Subscriptions will take effect
            at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use your Recurring Subscription after the price change takes effect. If you do not
            agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling your Recurring Subscription before the price change goes into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.</p>
        <p>Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. You may cancel a Recurring Subscription at any time, but if you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period, we will
            not refund any subscription fees already paid to us. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current subscription period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide
            a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our users ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance
            does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p>
        <p>If you purchase any Service through a mobile purchase or third-party marketplace (e.g., through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store), the refund policy applicable to that third-party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly
            stated by TraderClass. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by TraderClass, the third-party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and TraderClass will have no refund obligations. TraderClass
            disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third-party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.</p>

            violation of any rights of another. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor
            at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.</p>
        <p id="tit">8. Disclaimer of Warranties</p>
        <p>YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, TraderClass EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED
            OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

        <p id="tit">9. Limitation of Liability</p>
        <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT TraderClass WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, USE,
            DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF TraderClass HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE
            THE SERVICE; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE; (III)

        <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU
            ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>
        <p id="tit">10. Binding Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</p>
        <p>You and TraderClass agree that these Terms of Service affect interstate commerce and that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section 10 is intended to be interpreted
            broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us or the Terms of Service or the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
            fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.</p>
        <p>If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at TraderClass, 9 Floor, Vien Dong Building, 14 Phan Ton,Da Kao, 1 District, Ho Chi Minh City and support@TraderClass.com, and provide a brief,
            written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account). Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts
            to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
        </p>
        <p>All disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service or the Service that are not resolved by the procedures identified above shall be resolved by individual (not group) binding arbitration to be conducted
            before JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the
            arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, unless you
            and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration. For residents outside the United States, arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California, and you and TraderClass agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any
            federal or state court in San Francisco, California in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
        <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Service,
            including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Services are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in
            a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>TraderClass shall bear the cost of any arbitration filing fees and arbitration fees for claims of up to $75,000, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur
            in the arbitration including but not limited to attorneys’ fees and expert witness costs unless TraderClass is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. If your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000
            or less, and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person
            hearing.
        </p>
        <p>You and we agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party’s respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek
            relief on a class basis. YOU AND TraderClass AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any
            court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall
            be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, you or we may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property
            in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but
            not privacy or publicity rights). You or we may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction to the extent such claims do not seek equitable relief.</p>
        <p>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to TraderClass at the address identified in Section 14 below. The notice
            must be sent within thirty (30) days of (a) the “Date of Last Revision” date of these Terms of Service as set forth above; or (b) your first date that you used the Services that contained any versions of the Terms of Service that included
            this version of the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver, whichever is later. Otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions,
            TraderClass also will not be bound by them. If TraderClass changes this ‘Arbitration’ section after the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service), you may reject any such
            change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Date of Last Revision” date above or in the date of TraderClass' email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting
            any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and TraderClass in accordance with the provisions of this section as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes
            to these Terms of Service).
        </p>
        <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE ABOVE DISPUTE PROCEDURES SHALL BE YOUR SOLE REMEDY IN THE EVENT OF DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND TraderClass REGARDING ANY ASPECT OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING THE ENROLMENT PROCESS) AND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT
            TO LEAD OR PARTICIPATE IN A LAWSUIT INVOLVING OTHER PERSONS, SUCH AS A CLASS ACTION.</p>
        <p id="tit">11. Termination</p>
        <p>You agree that TraderClass, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for
            lack of use or if TraderClass believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your
            use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. TraderClass may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any
            termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that TraderClass may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information
            and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that TraderClass will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>
        <p id="tit">12. Disputes Between Users</p>
        <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service and TraderClass will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. TraderClass reserves the right, but has no obligation,
            to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.</p>
        <p id="tit">13. General</p>
        <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and TraderClass and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and TraderClass with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional
            terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict
            of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth in Section 10 above, you and TraderClass agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located
            within San Francisco County, California. The failure of TraderClass to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service
            is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms
            of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one
            (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating
            to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent
            of TraderClass, but TraderClass may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices
            to you may be made via either email or regular mail. Under no circumstances shall TraderClass be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from an event beyond its reasonable control. The Service
            may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>
